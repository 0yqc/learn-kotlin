# LEARN KOTLIN

Python is cool, but Kotlin is cooler and faster, so I wanted to learn it. Took [Midnight](https://midnight.hackclub.com/) as an opportunity for that. To test out Kotlin I developed some small algorthmic functions, mainly for math (one of my other passions besides coding), see below for a full list

# Features

- `BinomialCoefficient.kt`: Binomial Coefficient (both with formula and direct (faster))
- `CardGamePerfect.kt`: Least number `n` of cards required to evenly share all of them across `k` players for all `k` `1 .. POSITIVE_INFINITY` (`n = lcm(2, 3, ..., k - 1, k)`)
- `Classes.Kt`: Rectangle class with property for area (dynamically recalculating) and functions for circumference and diagonal (Pythagoras' theorem)
- `MostDivisors.kt`: All positive, whole numbers `n` with more divisors than all previous.
- `NumberGuess.kt`: Number guessing game, with a perfect-strategy bot (basic, but working)
- `PrimeNums.kt`: Efficiently coded prime number calculator using Sieve of Eratosthenes for an optimal performance

# Install

Download the Kotlin files and run them in your preferred Kotlin envoirement. They are all independent files only needing access to the terminal to run, no additional dependencies. (You will always need to run the appropriate file for the function you want to test/play/use)
